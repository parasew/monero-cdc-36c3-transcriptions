_**Abstract**_

Lightning talk on open data and the upcoming public sector information.

_**Transcription**_

_Diego:_ We are slightly, slightly behind, so we're like we need a lightning talk, a fast talk. And guess what we got it five minute talk, yeah. You don't believe me? Look he's running up here, oh my gosh, he's getting up here, real fast — everything he does is fast. He is Speedy Gonzales. Ok, so he's gonna make this happen. Can you introduce yourself to us?

_vavoida:_ Yeah, hi I'm Walt, I work for Knowledge Foundation German and we do a policy work, public data, open data and transparency.

_Diego:_ Unfortunately even though he's fast our team kind of ambles up here, so well we're gonna get this started as soon as the slides come up here, which should not be too long, and then we're gonna stick around for the OTR. See we actually planned this, we knew if, we knew that if people come for the good talks and we can get people to stay, sit through to other talks, to get to the talks that they want to get. I'm joking, you're gonna give a great talk and I'm gonna be thrilled to see ok. You said you have 25 slides to get through in five minutes? Ok, all right guys I hope you're good at shorthand — get out your notebooks, take out your pencils, you're gonna be writing really fast.

_vavoida:_ So basically this is just an invitation for the workshop to do more, so we'll cut it short, and I'm talking about open data. So the concept is similar from the talk before, it's about data, who owns it. And open data and public sector information is like directive from the European Union.

And that's not a slide format, and why we're doing is because I think open data is a critical decentralized knowledge. And it's an old Hector saying that you should use a public data and protect private data goes back to how Roland… and I think this slides formal little bit off, but basically open data anybody can use it freely, modified, shared and use it for any purpose.

And when we take a look at it, so the government owns some data, and that's knowledge, and they don't wanna always share it, and you have a cross, so it's open data which means like it is like the non personal data information.

And we are working on it to get this like public sector information directive going on the European level, and we have a couple of projects and the slides, I don't know what it's like cut it off, so this fits true so that's the status 2019, there's a new recast of it, so they have two years time for actually doing this, and one of the special things it's what we call high-value datasets, and high-value datasets basically I've like a specific use for the society.

And I will skip through that, so we save time, and we go to the public transportation case, and that’s my favorite case where I can see what it means the green area and German we have like open data for public transportation, so you and I want to go from A to B, you can find out on different services where you want to go. The other areas you sometimes get stuck somewhere, when you want to go from A to B you make a reroute. And stands in 2019 and in other countries in Europe you have the same issue. And I always make the joke if you continue by that speed we will first have like a human being on Mars before we have like open public transportation data in the European Union.

And that goes even though we had by now open standards, open definitions, open software and we could do that, and my favorite example what can be done or could be done, it's like digit transit from Helsinki, that was done by the public transportation authority in Helsinki, they created this platform on open source with open data, and somebody in Italy introduced that in the same real-time map for the past service for just 15 000 euro including the beacons to know where it should step into the bus.

And that you could do pretty much with every data the government owns. And was I'm saying so we could move from like this manual data shoveling, what you do with Excel sheets, do like an industrial scale rollout, because once you have like the data definition and open data, and open source software, you can scale it up. And yeah it's the case for other issues not just transportation, it's like beneficial ownership like who owns a company, who pays taxes, and pretty much that's it. As I could talk an election tomorrow at 6:30 at room 11, and I think that well my 5 minutes and 25 slides, and I hope you enjoy the next talk. Thank you.

_Diego:_ Man, did you deliver, okay.
