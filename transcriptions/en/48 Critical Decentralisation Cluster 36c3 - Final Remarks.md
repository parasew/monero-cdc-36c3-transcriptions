_Diego:_ I don't know about you, but I don't want to hear the word “decentralized” or “peer-to-peer” again for another month at least. Goodness, great goodness, that is way too much of all of this stuff.

Thank you so much everybody who came, our audience, people who came and made this happen. I'm gonna move right into the closing speech, I'm gonna move right into the closing time. I've got a list of people that I want to thank here. Some people are here, some people are not but I want to thank all these guys.

First of all huge, gigantic thanks to RIAT for everything that they did to make this village happen. These guys are literally machines — they do not sleep, they do not eat, they just work 24/7, and they made this thing possible. Without them we would not be here. So gigantic, gigantic thank you and round of applause for RIAT and everything that they did.

Monero community, the Monero community funded this to make it happen through the CCS. Some of them are here, but not as many as I would like. Those of you digitally at home, give yourself a pat on the back if you donated. If you did not you should feel bad about yourself and question your life choices.

But in particular with the RIAT people I want to thank nevvton, Markus, parasew, Mathias and Teemo (?), and Natty (?) for everything that they did, they've been here just like the whole time making sure everything went really smoothly. Let's give them a big, gigantic round of applause. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you a thousand million, billion “thank yous”.

We also had a board of the cluster that was here to kind of make the big decisions, that we're like the people sitting on the platforms with our arms crossed and looking down upon the masses. That board consists of Deanna McDonald, binaryfate, myself, Mattias, nevvton and Drew from OSHWA. So big thank you for that, reviewing the talks and making sure that we had the content for you guys.

The audiovisual people, my goodness, we have Oodie, we have Max, and we have AJS. Unfortunately AJS is not here, he already left. But Oodie and Max, you too, these are the guys sitting behind these computers all the time. Let's give them a great big round of applause. They kill me man. These guys never stopped going.

To all of our helpers and volunteers that have been here, we have, I'm gonna list them off here on my phone: we have jcross, the charlatan, Yosef, Matilda, Thomas, Hasbro Merkel, who just doing the Monero Talk interviews, Masha, Irene, afro, HP dang, Philip, Polto, NetG, bear, and Patricio. They were the ones who were here at the info desk answering questions, getting stuff when we need them, sometimes I send them to go get me some water and they did it. So let's give them a great big round of applause as well for their help at the village.

To all the assemblies that came here with us. So obviously Monero and RIAT have been hosting, but if it was just us it would be fairly boring. So we had other people here. We're so grateful that you guys could join us. We had Paralelni Polis over here, way back their Namecoin, Jeremy Rand was here representing Namecoin, OSHWA, FOSSASIA was doing a ton of different stuff over there, Axiom, Replicant back there, ImplicitCad, Swiss Cryptoeconomics more towards the front, and we got Oodie, the other psychedelic people back there that were hanging out for this whole time. So great big thanks to all of our assemblies that came and make this cluster possible. We can give them a snap, can we give them a snap, not quite a big round of applause, but we can give them kind of a snap, ok, yeah, great.

Big, big, big thanks to Chaos Computer Club for putting on the this C3 conference. Huge thanks to all of the angels and all the people who make this thing happen, and allow us to be here, and present, and show our little coins. That is we appreciate you guys so much, we really love to be here, and to give you guys great quality content about privacy, decentralization and all that kind of nonsense.

Once again big thank you to the Monero community for the CCS and to Monero Talk for doing the remote interviews — we're really glad that you they were available for the time that they were available.

That's it guys, we did it, we made it to the end. I'm so proud of the team that's been here. I'm very grateful for the audience. And we hope to be back next year to bring you more and more, and more. You can go to decentral.community, but now it's not going to tell you much, because we're done with all the scheduling, and we're doing with all the things. So you can go there, I just have been saying that this whole time I feel like it's appropriate to sign off by also saying “you should go to the decentral.community”.

So I've been Diego Salazar, your host this entire time. I'd like to thank you guys for having me. And it's time for us to tear down the cluster. If you would like to stay around and help, we’d more than be happy to have your service. If you don't want to do it because you're not obligated, that's also fine. So thank you so much, we hope to be back next year.
