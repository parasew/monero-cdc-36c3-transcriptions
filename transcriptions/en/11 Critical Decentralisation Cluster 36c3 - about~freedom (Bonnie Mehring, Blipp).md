_Diego:_ Alright Bonnie and Blipp, why don't you guys tell us about freedom?

_Bonnie:_ Yes, we are going to tell about freedom. And we are both from about:freedom actually, and we are cluster, and I got just going to shortly introduce you what we are, who we are and what we do.

So first of all we are about:freedom, we are cluster and focus on digital humans and rights and free software advocacy. about:freedom consists of politically active non-commercial organizations, and over time we grew, and now we have a child cluster named about:future. That's not actually written there, but that's the color for about:future — we have two colors: red and green. So and then there's the thing we all focus on political change, and as about:freedom we focus on helping to empower people in their self determined handling of technology. about:future has a focus on sustainability and social ecological transformation, particularly in the face of climate crisis. As it's also the motto for the Congress, yes it's a pretty good topic.

Yes we consist of different organizations, as I already mentioned, first of all there's the C3S which is a GEMA alternative basically, and they were founded in 2013 and are aiming to become our pan-european collecting society for music. One of our core features is support for all six standard creative common licenses in addition to standard copyright to technology infrastructure is developed as free and open-source software, mostly GPL and AGPL.

Then we also have the PEP foundation. Maybe some of that if you have already heard of it. It advocates privacy and the PEP engine, they have an engine, most developed for this purpose and drive several crypto standards and different digital channels. It shall assume at least our privacy by default and PEP is engine accessibility as free software to support privacy for everyone. At that PEP aims to restore the balance again involve all communications in favor of privacy and freedom in information.

But we are also having some international organizations joining us. We have the EFF, maybe some of you have already heard of it. They are aiming for you to create a world for you that you want to live in, for our grassroots activists inspire people to take action in their communities, our legal team fights for our fundamental rights and freedoms in the courts suing against overreaching laws and policies. And our team of technologists produces freedom and housing software like cerebrate for the world.

We also have the FSFE and for transparency I work currently for the FSFE, so that the logo of the FSFE, that's the Free Software Foundation Europe. It's a charity that empowers users to control technology, software deeply involved in all aspects of our lives. And it is important that this technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support our fundamental rights like freedom of speech, freedom of press and privacy. They are also going to be some sessions regarding free software on the second day tomorrow, so they will be disguised off by mines, at half-past six in Dexter room eleven, and about problem on a public code on day three at two o'clock in the Cosna stage.

Then we have an epicenter.works joining us. epicenter.works tries to find ways forward based on human rights. We see ourselves as representatives of interest for basics and freedoms rights, we stand up for strong voices in civil society, and we advocate for a responsible and reasonable management of the opportunities to raise technology.

But there are also some others like the Digitale Gesselchaft which is, I'm sorry, I don't even know what they are doing, and it just locked my phone. It's a cherub organizations that is committed on two fundamental and human rights and open knowledge culture as well as the transparency and participation in this social decision-making processes.

We also have Gesselchaft fur Freiheitsrechte, Gesselchaft fur Freiheitsrechte I don't know… founder of them… Ok, then I they have a podcast larger in iTune. So I introduce them, the a Berlin-based non-profit NGO founded in 2015. Its mission is to establish a sustainable structure for successful strategic litigation in the area of human and civil rights in Germany and Europe. GFF’s longer-term mission is to help protect and strengthen human and civil rights in general by legal means, thus permanently improving human and civil rights law all over Europe.

We also have some other organizations, they are actually also having a band, that will play in the about freedom cluster tonight at ten o'clock, it's called they are doing post punk something, no… something like punk things with electronic music. So if you want to show up there it will be really fun. There like our organization and initiative for data protection and informational self-determination with political actions and parties. We critically bring the subject of surveillance to the public. They also have some really funny actions that they do that they talk, like standing in front of the parliament and standing around and suit courts I think, these cameras on the head, so they are fun group, so if you want to have a look at them come to our class about:freedom and you find them.

There you also have Crypto Party, they're going to have a session on day four, from one o'clock to 3 at lecture room 11, so if you ever wanted to know how to encrypt an email you can come there and then they'll help you, and show you how to do this. That's basically what they do.

And we also have Datenschmutz. Datenschmutz it's also working with Rote Hilfe, and Rote Hilfe as a paralegal organization helping people who get into legal trouble because of progressive activism. While Datenschmutz is watching computer use by German authorities mostly policy and help people the freedom of information requests to them.

We also have Amnesty International mentioned on site, that works increasingly on human rights and the digital age.

And last but not least for about:freedom we have, that's the FIFF, Forum InformatikerInnen für Frieden und gesellschaftliche Verantwortung, and that's a German bite Association founded in 1984 of about 700 people who critically examined the effects of the use of computers science and information or technical technology on science, yes.

And now Blipp is going to introduce a very shortly the people from about:future

_Blipp:_ So, about now you heard about like the classical about:freedom organizations, the new sub cluster. about:future is about social ecological transformation, the climate crisis, and there we give place to several organizations that work in this space. For example Bits and Baume which is basically a label that is used by a lot of events that work around digital sustainability.

It was a conference in 2018, we have C3SUS which is the sustainability orga team of C3 events. For example we organized tap water dispensers for angels.

Computer Werk is charity taking hardware donations, installing free software on laptops and giving them away for people that cannot afford computer.

BUND Jugend is a youth organization of BUND which is like a big German ecological organization pushing for policy change to protect the environment.

I guess you all know Fridays for Future and their climate strikes, they are here as well. There is one spontaneous climate strike today on Congress at 9:45, starting at our cluster. So please come by. And there is another official Fridays for Future demonstration on Sunday, day 3, in the City Center at 11 a.m. So from your sleeping place just go directly to the demonstration and then come to Congress.

Developers for Future are supporting the Fridays for Future and all the other “for Future” organizations with IT infrastructure, but also like giving talks and educational material about how to make IT greener.

Extinction Rebellion is a group that uses civil disobedience to make it clear that the climate crisis is a real problem.

Then we have the German Network for Effective Altruism. Effective Altruism tries to use reason and science to determine how to do good in the most effective and efficient way. So go talk to them about rationality, less wrong cognitive biases.

Then we have a Konzeptwerk Neue Okonomie who think about alternative economic models post growth, they give talks about that, workshops. They try to network with other organizations in that field.

And finally Roundtable Repair is pushing for political change to establish a right to repair such that we produce less electronic waste.

And then there is the Haccers Against Climate Change group called HACC which was founded last year during Congress which is like hackers that want to use technology to visualize the problem of climate crisis, use public data but also try to make software more sustainable.

_Bonnie:_ And they also have experiment at our cluster so you should definitely come by and have a look at this one.

_Blipp:_ Yeah, learn about ripehouseeffect like translate it to English please.

So that was all. We have a twitter account and of course a Fatty verse account because this is much more sustainable than a central twitter service. So check that out. So we have the Fridays for Future demonstration 9:45. And at 10:00 p.m. a concert. Thank you very much, come check us out — we have a huge space with sofas and everything. It's in CCL, in this direction, same level.

_Bonnie:_ Next to the info desk…

_Diego:_ Yeah, I was gonna ask about that — where you guys were located, because I don't think you said for those who didn't catch, it sorry… let me, let me, so that everyone can see my lovely face on the stream. For those who didn't catch they are, their own cluster, they are not a part of us. We don't want to be associated with them any further then on this… I'm just kidding, you guys are best friends. They actually have several talks coming up on our stage over these next few days. So be sure to be here for all of those, these all sound very fascinating about the sustainability of the future and the present and stuff. So I for one, I'm looking forward to that. So you guys, you guys are welcome anytime, please go visit their cluster — they've got great stuff. Maybe not quite as good as us, but you know we are the highest standard. So thank you guys so much for everything, for letting us know about that. Actually I, actually might go, and like I can't leave this cluster because I work here so, but I may sneak off to see you guys because you're really cool. Ok let's give them a great big hand. Thank you guys so much.
