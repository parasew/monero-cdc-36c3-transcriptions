_Diego:_ Now if I could get Matthias up here. We are going to go through our schedule online, because we don't trust you guys to be literate enough to do it yourselves. So we are going to go through it and show you guys all the cool things… once he ambles his way up here… Hello

_Matthias:_ Hello, hello

_Diego:_ Hello. So, this is not our schedule, this is also not our schedule… we're getting nearer, we're getting closer…. If you want to follow along you can take out your little cell phones and go to decentral.community, decentral.community… Oh-oh, we're almost there. What about all these lights, huh? What do you I think this is of light everywhere constantly? It's like the stars in the sky.

_Matthias:_ It's holding.

_Diego:_ For those of you who have extremely good eyesight, you can see the URL right there: decentral.community, for the rest of you — you can kind of do this and try to see it and one day the internet at C3 will be good, and we will be able to see these things. Until then… you know maybe we can just pretend we see the schedule here, and we can go through it together. The team is working as hard as they can. For one minute over.

So right after this right off to give you a sneak preview of the schedule, right after this we have our Monero presentation from Daniel Kim, it's our only keynote today, and it's gonna finish us off today. He's going to take us through everything: the thick the thin, the economics, the cryptography, he knows everything about everything, a big brain time. So please come to that one, he'll answer every question about Monero, about life — he's got it all. So that is directly after this, starts in about 14 minutes. You want to be here for that one.

Network is overloaded. So that means it's time to use my phone because I have it pulled up here. Once again if you have your phone and you can connect to it, you can go to Decentral Community to follow along here. Those of you watching at home, those of you watching in the great big audience — we are going to go through these things.

Tomorrow, day two, Saturday, December the 28th, we are going to start at 1 p.m. We're gonna start at 1:00. I'm gonna come up here, give another 15 minute opening presentation, speak for about 2 to 3 minutes and go like: oh my gosh, I still have 8-9 minutes to fill, just exactly like what happened today, is gonna be a repeat of tomorrow. After which point actually you're gonna have even more of me, because I am kick starting the day off with our first talk that is (how many how, long do I have to talk? 15 minutes, ok — that's not that bad). I'm gonna be talking about funding models of FOSS, Free Open Source Software, I'm just kind of talking about the various funding models that people have come up with to make their open source software projects work. We've got a pretty big variety and open sources it can be difficult to monetize.

Next we got Ome, you guys remember Ome, he's from Swiss Cryptoeconomics, and they're gonna be talking with us. I really wish, can you guys see, this is what he's gonna be speaking to us about. Yeah, ok, we can move on now. In this talk we will discuss forks as human consensus failure modes, why they happen and their consequences. We'll look at examples of forks in different social structures from hunter-gatherer tribes, whew, and religious factions to open-source projects and particularly the cryptoeconomic protocols that enable decentralized infrastructure. Very pretentious. You want to be here for that — he's gonna talk about religious forks. That's really kind of crazy. As well then… no still no luck? When? The when that is directly after my talk, if you don't want to listen to me talk, that is at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow.

Wait. You know what, let me do this. So I'm getting networked, let me put a hotspot. Yeah that's a good idea. Just one second guys, we're gonna make this happen. Just one second, I don't see it here, why? Ok CC, almost there. Connection fails. Goodness gracious. I'm sorry guys, I tried, I really did, I failed, you know. So yeah once again take out your phones, yeah take out your phones, the decentral.community.

_Matthias:_ So we are still on day one right?

_Diego:_ Yeah, oh, day two, today…

_Matthias:_ Yeah.

_Diego:_ Actually right. Next up is your thing — a workshop Open Hardware Dialog.

_Matthias:_ Yeah, I could speak a little bit about that. So we would be looking at… so I think it's like entered for two hours, but it can be longer because we have like multiple areas where we can hold the workshop, so tomorrow would be a small workshop are called Black Crystal, it's the fourth iteration of the workshop where we will be looking at different implementations of the Trazor Crryptolib. So we will be learning from Trezor Cryptolib on different implementations, on different hardware, and we will stop actually a new repository where we will enter this kind of findings. Please get in contact with us though earlier if you want to participate in this workshop, because we have not an unlimited amount of devices with us, so I think we can possibly block two people share device like work with like 20 people max, something like that.

_Diego:_ After so that is actually going to be going on during some talks up here on the stage, so if you're interested in that workshop you would have to miss some of the talks. If you're interested in the talks you'd have to miss the workshop, or you don't have to be here at all. There's plenty of other C3 to watch and to look at.

Right after that two o'clock we have the Secret Truecrypt Audit. Oh yeah, look it, we got it. Ok, they're gonna switch the screen. The Secret Truescript Audit, there's not much information beyond that, so you could take from that what you will want. For those of you who don't know what Truecrypt is, it's a way for you to increase, it's a software and open source software that allows you to encrypt your files, encrypt your operating systems, make secret encryption things, pretty neat. It's no longer in use but plenty of spin-offs from it have plenty of forks, not spin-offs, like VeraCrypt which is the biggest one. So the Secret TrueCrypt Audit — if you're into conspiracy theories this is the one you want to go to.

_Matthias:_ So what three we will have a P2P Trading in Cryptoanarchy that set talk from Bisq I believe. We will be talking about the Bisq system and about different uses for this decentralized exchange which is Busy is.

_Diego:_ Bisq is really cool, it's the biggest currently decentralized exchange system for crypto currencies. We got continually running FOSS ASIA workshop, so this one right here is by Mario who just spoke today with us about FOSS ASIA. They're gonna be. If you can go there and go there, and meet their community, they're waving right over here: hey guys, you're the best, you're the greatest, yeah. Oh I don't need my phone anymore. Then we have ArcticMine, Francisco Cabanas, who is a Monero core team member, who is gonna be talking with us about my Monero’s approach to scaling. So if you guys like: I have a question about scaling, that always happens, this is the talk you're gonna want to come to. He's gonna talk about Monero’s plans for scaling, what we've already done, what we've implemented so far.

_Matthias:_ Then we have a talk about Nym. This is actually also organized by one of the assemblies by a Swiss Crypto and this is about an incentivized a mixnet based on Tor. So yeah excited about this one. After that we have a workshop, ice! He has written ‘worshop’ but it's actually a workshop on crypto-AML also from Swiss Cryptoeconomic. This will be Polto and there will be also I guess is an ongoing workshop which should run longer, so some of the workshops that I entered here entered in a very short timeframe. Don't worry, I guess like when they're happening directly at the assemblies that can be added or can be normal. So please get in contact with the assemblies directly.

_Diego:_ I want you to note the wording: “I plan to organize a workshop”. So we will see if these plans go awry or if they actually go as intended.

So next up Digital integrity of the human person. So is this one from Paralelni Polis? It is not. Ok. Well every description abstract, that's how you know that this person is a researcher, scientist, they provide us an abstract, not just a description. Every human evolves today in multi-dimensional physical and digital environment. Didn't we have this talk last year?

_Matthias:_ No but it's a similar topic.

_Diego:_ Ok, so we had a similar topic, but yeah the human person, the digital person this is definitely something that you want to go into, if you're as we're moving into the future very rapidly changing, where humans are using digital stuff. Oh they're telling us five minutes. We got a hurry man.

Ok, we got a workshop Intro to POAP. POAP, that's right. There were Cryptoeconomics people. Yeah, there's gonna be a workshop over there with the Cryptoeconomics group. We're probably not gonna have time to finish all of these and you guys are like thank goodness we could look out of this ourselves, you guys are waiting for Daniel Kim, he is in his dressing room, he is getting the makeup, he is getting his big star, so he can come on here and talk with you guys, he'll be here very soon.

_Matthias:_ And so maybe if we don't go to all of this in detail at least we can note that a few smaller changes might be happening to the schedule at least because there is of course delays and things, but also the workshops might take longer shorter and so on. So please also don’t take the schedule as for granted, always check off rep which has the latest version of the schedule. Currently we're at version 2 and I expect still one version more to be happening.

_Diego:_ If you guys are one of the speakers or workshop people and you contact us last-minute and say: can we change the time, we can but we hate you. So keep that in mind. So we are getting close to get kicking us off the stage, that's pretty much it for tomorrow, we've got a couple other things, once again decentral.community, the website is very pretty, I made it myself, so you can compliment me about that later.
