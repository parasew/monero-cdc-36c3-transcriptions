_Diego:_ Let's do a few neck rolls, let's do a few neck rolls, let's relax. Nobody's doing it with me? All right, I'll go and pass this off. Come on out Matthias and let's talk about RIAT.

_Matthias:_ Thank You Diego, amazing. Hello everyone. My name is Matthias Tarasiewicz and I'm from the RIAT from the RIAT Institute and I want to explain you a little bit about what we are doing and what also we try to do here with the cluster at the C3.

So I will introduce a little bit RIAT itself, so we an institute that means we are NGO and we are doing research, development, communication and education in the fields of cryptography, privacy technologies and the future of decentralization. That's the mission the basic mission of RIAT, so to say we have an office and lab in Austria, we have a few different groups which work across Europe, mostly Europe, one smaller group in the US, and we have in a way a lot of these central ways of working together already since 2012.

And as I said we have an NGO structure that means we're trying to work and educate people around the topics of privacy and decentralization since quite some while already, and we've been through all these kind of blockchain types and so on and we are still existing which is a good thing I guess. So we are also trying to advance these topics because especially if you remember this kind of blockchain hype times and ICO hype times like there was a lot of like shallow discussion in this whole field I think there's like a lot more to gain from this technology still if you understand it better. So maybe to explain a little bit more of the organization, so we exist in 2012 and it's a kind of a I would say not a merger because it's not a commercial thing, so we have been kind of integrating different groups, we have been having two before, so that was for example the group “artistic bokeh” which was looking into like different camera hacks and like advancing camera technologies these LAR hacks and so on. Then we had the group “supernet” who was existing it was existing since early 2003, it was a kind of an artistic group running a large exhibition space in Vienna mainly, and we are also organized and started the Coded Cultures initiative back then, this was all around like 2004-2005. This all got merged into RIAT and this explains a little bit why we have this kind of artistic background as well.

So this is our labs and our offices, how they look when they are empty, I just found images when they are empty actually but for people to see. So this is in Austria, in Vienna. And this is some set up so here you see some funny small exhibition featuring some DAO punching machine where you could punch the creators of the DAO physically in this kind of boxing machine. So um yeah here you see a snapshot of one of our workshop areas so in this case it's also the RIAT hardware lab where we're working, so it looks like messy but I kind of like this photo. And I'm here you see a map of when we tried to map a little bit what was achieved by RIAT but also in a kind of an Austrian, it's not meant nationalistic, it's like more there's this kind of Austrian shape in the background. So I'm just able to explain also I chose this image now, to explain a little bit RIAT. So for us we somehow went through all this hype so there's a you see very good that kind of blockchain search term “hypes” on the bottom of the of this image. And at the same time the world in my opinion this shows also how the whole shift has happened, in this kind of crypto currency space and in this kind of decentralization space, because in the beginning it was very much DIY led and community-led process, the whole thing was very much undertaken by individuals or like small groups or people that really wants to change something. In my opinion is this changed a lot in 2016-2017 when we saw this commercialization or this kind of heavy hype of blockchain at the same time. Me personally I was not so fascinated by this kind of hyper momentum but more when there was a kind of a grassroot element to it and when there was a specific change that was promised, that all these conditions is analyzation could bring us. So in a way it's interesting on this image also to see that there's a lot of like meetups we started so also to explain what RIAT does, we do a lot of like physical meetings like people are in a way of discussing different technologies, learning from each other, and in this way also the program at the cluster is very much related to what we are doing.

So we are mainly working in this three fields, which is open hardware, privacy and anonymity and coded cultures which is this kind of term with that we created with this other art groups back in 2009 when we had a festival with the same name which tried to bring hacker culture and technological culture closer together in the in the field of art artistic domain.

So these are also the three labs that we currently run at RIAT. So there's the RIAT Open Hardware Lab, the Artistic Technology Lab and the Future Cryptoeconomics Lab, I want to give a brief insight in what these labs do.

So to start with the right Open Hardware Lab, and there's also people from the lab here, so you will also see in the next day's a few elements in the program and in the workshops around open hardware. So we started working with this project which is the Apertus AXIOM, open source cinema camera, quite some while ago, we still a little bit working with them but not so closely anymore, it was a rising project that we that we did back in I think it was like 2016 or something, and there's also a talk of mine from 32c3, about the project in case you didn't see it yet when I explained like what are the challenges in open hardware project how documentation becomes a necessary element that is often overlooked, and what are all these kind of elements that are that would make up a successful open hardware project. The funny thing is an open hardware project they usually don't have a business model so it was also interesting just for us to understand like how they work. So we are fascinated on the different elements of open hardware project and we're also technically in the within our lab. So this is like one good example of a publication that we are doing, so we're doing multiple publications also from the labs this is a little bit older one this is from 2016 but this has already a few more volumes of it, it's called ‘Openism: Conversations in Open Hardware’, and we started to investigate a little bit qualitatively how different open hardware projects work, what do they understand about open hardware. So what are they opening is, how libre is their hardware that is actually presented. And we got quite a bunch of people together that we interviewed and we published in a very nice book that you can also here seen our info table, and we love to also make an interview with you about the open hardware project in case you're in this domain. Specifically I was fascinated in getting to know these projects a little bit better in this regard and also to understand what are the different motivations, so for example for example David Cuartielles you might know as one of the inventors of the Arduino board, I don't we know still is one of the most important open hardware project because they figured out a way how to basically, I mean their model is pretty nice it did a lot to the maker movement it was very important, but also at the same time there's a lot of potential that is untouched still with open hardware. So for example also this book we've got a very nice text basically talking about if there could be something like a return of investment calculated with open hardware project. So there's a lot of different approaches to open hardware in there and we are also continuing this series so our please get in contact with us or if you want to have one of these books they are on info table.

In this context also the RIAT Open Hardware Lab I would have a few workshop here at the cluster, so we will run one workshop tomorrow, we don't have too many seats because this is like based on the specific hardware that we brought with us, so get in touch with us if you are interested in joining there, so the idea here is to look at the Trezor Crypto Lib and to see how this is actually functioning and how what we can learn from it. So Trezor Crypto Lib is in my opinion very important in terms of open hardware, because Trezor is a very nice open hardware piece, and it's a y'all know Trezor device possibly. What's nice about it is that the software is very good documented you can port it on another device as well so you don't have to run it on your own Trezor if you're very paranoid, you can create the MMC you can rebuild everything, and we are trying to see what can we learn from the Trezor Crypto Lib, how good is a document that what kind of different crypto workflows can we get with simple devices that are not that fastest, usual crypto accelerated devices, we are working with here with a simple thing which is basically the other you know are these the ideas like people can with the other Arduino IDE develop different very simple cryptographic primitives that can learn from the cryptographic workflows and they can use it in the project, so that's what we'll be starting tomorrow.

To give you a short inside also artistic technology lab, this a little bit intersecting with the term that I said before, with the coded cultures term, so for me this whole started this whole lab started with the Coded Cultures festival that we organized from 2004 until 2011. I think there was one issue awesome 2015, it was a large festival like bringing like agriculture and different artistic communities together in a large exhibition space usually, and this was also including workshops which took place all over the year, so there was a very in-depth book we created from one year almost this was released in 2011, and this is called ‘Coded Cultures New Creative Practices out of Diversity’ where we're looking specifically at Japanese hacker culture, like Japanese device culture and their approach to openness, but also their artistic approaches, and this got me like thinking because what was interesting also in this regard was to see that a lot of these developments, there's even a term for that in Japanese it's called Shindogo, the unused objects you have all this kind of interesting non-commercial or act like anti-consumerist devices in open hardware communities or like, and the consumers production approaches which I found interesting, and so I dug deeper into that so that became the artistic technology lab which was an actual lab which we installed this annually bursting in Austria in Vienna.

So also at the same time like a little bit at the time of ending this book this lab started to create the Bitcoincloud which was the very first Bitcoin related our piece this was it's maybe I'm also often overlooked because the website is not up again still so you can find it on an archive.org still an old website of that and maybe to show you some pictures and maybe funny ideas behind it, so it was actually the most inefficient mining rig ever built because people would only mined if they would watch the art piece, we put some sensors in there, and basically it was a stupid idea back at the time because I mean would we have minded we would have a lot of bitcoins but back in this time when Bitcoin was a little bit below $1, it seems like a reasonable idea that Bitcoin was good actually in order to make the point that Earth has this kind of speculative momentum because the artistic object also is like why is something worth that meant that much it's like really was interesting to us fast it goes how value it gets actually created in art or production like in art pieces, and so we tried to work in this direction so this had various iterations so we had around I think like eight versions of the art piece it was traveling all over the world, we had shown in multiple places and there's also still a summary about the project. If you're interested we have also still the old and everything it's super outdated super old Bitcoin version but it still up there.

But this also is interesting because I wanted to show you a more recent approach that we took now with all these kind of different artifacts that we collected throughout the years. So starting from the Bitcoincloud we started to collect a lot of like different pieces from the I would say larger crypto sphere we collected a lot of like early prototypes from hardware devices, as you can see here on the image for example there's one of the switch ports of the BitcoinCloud that we hand etched and everything then there's a for example manipulated different devices that we just kept like old versions of devices all different sorts of like devices around cryptography and arts that we are collecting and that we are putting in something that we call decentral process of decentral archive of process artifacts. So this is something that the lab also creates and we have a very large archive until now there will also be a publication coming out in February of next year where we will explain a little bit the background of it and we will show case a few of these of these devices. So last year if somebody was here the cluster you saw possibly a few of our devices from the from the lab which we brought with us last year.

So this is another thing that is produced by the Artistic Technology Lab this is the journal for research cultures which is an academic publication which is currently published annually there's like three different new editions coming out so you can find this online it's an open access Journal for Research Cultures and currently that's one issue out but we are planning to launch three different issues in the next year

And finally I want to talk a little bit about the Future Cryptoeconomics Lab which is a more recent lab. So we started this actually in 2016 as part of our RIAT as well so you might have seen this newspaper that we also have an hour info table that we can that we give out to people for free of cost so if you're interested please come to us and you can of course get one of those issues so continuing this idea of the publication that I showed before this open harbor dialogues we somehow map this as a kind of a general method for us to learn to explore different projects so we started to get in touch with all the different product we found interesting in the wider scope of crypto economics or I would say not only crypto economics but distributed systems and we tried to understand the different design approaches of these decentralized systems we try to understand what are the different motivations of the players so for example in this issue which is the first issue of this of this magazine and there's like four more to come also next year we made a lot of different interviews with for example Vitalic Buterin or people that made this kind of cryptographic decentralized system that we have today. But we're also trying to understand a little bit the limitations of this kind of utopian visions or different visions that are somehow put into place there in software so for example you have heard of this kind of term of the immutable code, unstoppable codes with the theorem this was for example largely stopped or like not being the case after the DAO fork I don't know if most of you people know that but these are all elements which showed me that this huge topic of decentralization is more a kind of a promise than it is an actual fact so we are very far away from actual decentralization when we look also where our data is what kind of networks and the censorship we have these days so in my opinion it's important to stay sharp here and this is why we created this kind of format which is published in the magazine so you can also if you want the digital copy just mail us or let us know you find more information on it on the RIAT website and you could of course also meet us here at the cluster and talk to us so a lot of people of ours are here I won't go into too much detail about what we did with the cluster and how we envisioned a specific setting of different people meeting because there will be another small introduction that Diego will be giving about the program which will be I guess in one hour or so yeah so thank you very much for listening and I'm happy to also answer any questions

_(speaking with Diego)_ if there are any the questions no no history.
