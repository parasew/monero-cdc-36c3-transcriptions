_**Abstract**_

Presentation of the members and working groups of the Swiss Cryptoeconomics assembly.

_**Transcription**_

_Diego:_ I know about you guys but I am a ready to go. We got our next people up here, they're gonna be talking about their little thing, their assembly, their little table back there, you can come visit them. I would like to invite Ome and Polto onto the stage. They're gonna be talking with you guys about Swiss Cryptoeconomics assembly and what they do. So go and come on up guys and let us know what you got. Let’s give them a hand.

_Polto:_ Thanks. Hi.

_Ome:_ Hello. So we are Swiss Cryptoeconomics, we are an assembly back there as Diego introduced us, and maybe we can go onto the next slide. I have no hands sorry.

_Polto:_ You wanted that one.

_Ome:_ Yeah. Yeah, okay. So Swiss Cryptoeconomics: why Swiss, why Cryptoeconomics?

_Polto:_ So Switzerland as you may know is a very interesting country in terms of its political structure. We have a quite decentralized political system where the cantons, the local states have most of the power. So we don't have this same political system is in most Europe where there is a central government that may impeach some create a project or something like that to emerge. So it's a very good ecosystem for the decentralized projects to emerge.

_Ome:_ And Cryptoeconomics is because we have been a group of people from primarily working in Swiss Romande in the area of cryptocurrencies and decentralization, and we started inviting our friends from the community, and after three years we were putting together a nice assembly, and we are giving nice content. Well first of all it's a meeting point for all these people here and then we're going to be contributing with talks, workshops, and discussion groups.

_Polto:_ Mainly on these topics and points of interest: cryptoeconomics, decentralization, governance, P2P, sorry, peer-to-peer and web3, privacy, and ethics.

_Ome:_ And we would like to give a little word about all the different projects and communities that have some representation within our assembly. So this is the list, I think we got all of them, and we're going to just give a few words about them.

_Polto:_ So yes some are like independent developers and they don't want it to be cited here with a particular project, but for those who did, let's just briefly cite them. So Alephiume is a decentralized and scalable blockchain with efficient cross-charted transaction. So they are working on this.

_Ome:_ Bonfire.link is a community initiative experimenting with tools for, and models for self-organization and local action.

_Polto:_ Bullshit.money is my satirical project, it's a C20 talking, talk about, to trigger discussion basically about decentralization, about values, scarcity, motivation of tokenization, and all these kind of things that are quite often bullshit.

_Ome:_ DAppNode is an open source software for building censorship resistant infrastructure layer owned and managed by individuals.

_Polto:_ DataFund or Fair Data Society is a project to transform data into assets on fair data principles.

_Ome:_ Iden3 is self sovereign identities on Ethereum.

_Polto:_ Merklizer a simple project to anchor and verify data on public blockchain.

_Ome:_ NYM is an incentivized and decentralized mixnet that can provide better unlimited on Tor for cryptocurrency and messaging applications.

_Polto:_ POAP an open protocol for decentralized identities.

_Ome:_ And finally Statebox – diagrammatic language for modeling processes in a compositional way and a formally verified technology stack for executing them.

_Polto:_ So we are the assembly which is straight at the end of the Critical Decentralization Cluster, you can find us there, and welcome to discuss all of these projects.

_Ome:_ And just maybe to highlight one of the most interesting workshops that we have tomorrow, I think, it's going to be from high school math to Zk-snarks, and it's gonna be a six-hour workshop that I believe is going to be very interesting. Thank you very much for your attention. If you have any question to us, there's a microphone here.

_Polto:_ Not too many at a time.

_Ome:_ So we have more time, so maybe we can go back to topics and interests, so maybe we can talk a bit of cryptoeconomics and how does that fit within this cluster?

_Polto:_ Honestly I would cover like you already talked about the Zk-snarks workshop, I would may be covered up not because I think it's also interesting and maybe interesting for many people here. So DAppNode is building self-hosted infrastructure to really control your own nodes, and it's a kind of Linux distribution, where you can install in models that will be also distributed in a decentralized way using IPFS, and here during the workshop you can learn how to build your own model for the DAppNode to deploy your own software on these DAppNodes. It may be a blockchain, something blockchain related but it can also be non blockchain project like Nextcloud or whatever else. That may be hosted on your DAppNode.

_Ome:_ And maybe also to explain a bit more about POAP, so we have attendance badges for the cluster, so if you go to the assembly you can get a little piece of paper with accurate code and if you scan it you will receive… oh, come on show it here… Okay, so you have a little piece of paper that you can with accurate code that you can scan and it will give you a non-fungible token on Etherium that contains a proof that you were in the cluster.

_Polto:_ Thanks. Do you know…

_Ome:_ Do we have more time?

_Polto:_ Ya, we have almost…

_Ome:_ All right. So maybe let's talk about the how cryptoeconomics fits within this cluster? So for the centralized infrastructure this in which… there is no central authority, there needs to be some ways to align the behavior of the different participants in the in these networks, so that's primarily the point of cryptoeconomics: is how do we align this incentives with an economic model and it's crypto, because it uses cryptography to enable these systems. Want to help me?

_Polto:_ I think, well, we can wrap up here.

_Ome:_ It's important for decentralization and it opens discussions about governance, because they these protocols at the end are controlled by my people that run this software in their machines. Yeah we're gonna have many discussions about that, so you're very well very much invited to join us in those discussions. Thank you.

_Diego:_ Thank you very much, Ome and Polto of Swiss Cryptoeconomics once again, they're kind of more towards the back of this cluster, they're closer to the food, so good for them. You by all means go ahead and visit them back there.
