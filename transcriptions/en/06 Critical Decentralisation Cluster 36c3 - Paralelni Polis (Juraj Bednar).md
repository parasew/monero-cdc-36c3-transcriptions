_Diego:_ So we're gonna be talking with, oh my gosh, dude, I forgot your name.

Jurai, okay we're gonna be talking with you Jurai, who's gonna be talking with us about Paralelni Polis, that is so hard to say the two else are making it difficult to say for me, to say at least, he's gonna tell us what they do it's really, really interesting. I'm not gonna spoil it, there's no spoilers, this is a spoiler free stage, if you've seen the new Star Wars please don't tell anybody about it, and he won't he won't spoil that either, I promise, but the reviews have not, they've been very mediocre. So let's go ahead and invite you down to the stage, and I yeah I think we're all set up for him.

_Jurai:_ Thank you. So hello we are from Paralelni Polis. Oh, slides now work. So originally there was only Praha, but last year we added Bratislava to the slides, and now the other ones don't fit on the slide, so I will have to tell you about them, the new ones like Barcelona and Vienna. So what is it? When you come to Prague, it's a building that quite nicely represents what the place is about. There is a cafeteria, there is a co-working space and there is a venue we call Institute of Cryptoanarchy where you can learn more.

There are other parts to it, both physical in the space and also virtual like the Hackers Congress, which is our annual event about cryptoanarchy, and it's one of the few cypherpunk conferences out there. So I also didn't mentioned Crypto Hackerspace, which is like a small hacker space where you can play with crypto.

So first this is the Prague space. What I really like about these communities, also RIAT and other places, T.A.Z. Zero from Berlin, is that you can never explain what is happening inside, what the projects are in any kind of short talk, so there are so many interesting things going on that you literally need to go there and spend a few months in each of these places in order to understand what these people are doing. I still haven't figured it out, so it's really interesting.

So this is how the place in Prague looks like. There are some weird features such as 3d printed ashtrays and weird Creative Commons music that plays in the cafeteria in order to avoid centralized intellectual property taxes I would say.

This is the Institute of Cryptoanarchy in Prague. What we do are is based on a few concepts one of them is the Cryptoanarchy Manifesto which is a document from early 1990s, and it describes how you can avoid being observed on the Internet, and if you cannot be observed or if are eventually observed, how to make it difficult for any outside attacker to see what is going on. So that means encrypted chatrooms, mixnets, digital money and so on. What we wanted to try is to see if this idea on the Internet can be implemented in a physical space in a community.

So I'm not going to talk about particular projects, but I will tell you something about a few practical experiences, so there of course interactions with the state, for example because of the boycott of Electronic Submission of Transactions, which is a state surveillance system that collects data about the shopping behavior of all citizens, that's also in Czech Republic and also in Slovakia now. So Paralelni Polis is one of the few places that doesn't report this data to the government. Right now the Czech National Bank said that they have the monopoly on the word “coin” or “mince”, so you cannot use this word unless you have a stamp from Czech National Bank, which is also funny. We are testing real world usability of cryptocurrencies because you can only pay with cryptocurrencies in these spaces, we don't accept state money. In Bratislava we started deploying internal token for rewarding volunteers, so it's on internal network, and we are experimenting about how to scale this concept in a decentralized way, but we've without losing the values.

A few more pictures. This is as you can see Lutz Quebec there, she can pay in the terminal with her hand, with her chip implant. There are some more cyborgs that are able to pay with cryptocurrencies by their implants.

We would like to encourage growth and we believe that small scale is important. So this is how we scaled to Bratislava, just a few architectonical ideas, and this is how the place looks now. It's also a cafeteria and studio in the back. So these places are growing and… I will just skip this part.

What's next? I will talk about what's next also tomorrow at 6 p.m. in a more detailed fashion, what we are doing and what we are preparing to do. But I would like to mention this project which is Decentruck, which is a mobile Paralelni Polis that can drive to a place where it's needed the most, and supported by market forces hopefully. And it can contain portable coffee machine, like the one that we have in the back, where you can get coffee, and so on. And we are now thinking about implementing this idea in a form of shipping containers.

So that's a brief overview and tomorrow at 6:00 I will talk more in detail about what we are doing right now, at least part of us. And I don't know if we have time for questions? Three minutes, okay. So if you have questions, we still have time for questions. Yes.

_Audience:_ How is the whole thing financed?

_Jurai:_ Oh, okay. So financing is very diverse I would say. We sell coffee and hope to make profit on it, that doesn't work that much that well. We sell spaces in our seats in co-working space, entrance fee to some of the talks, crowdfunding, we have members that that pay membership fees, we have a board of directors who are more entrepreneurial, but people not companies, who support us with more money, than the regular members so, they choose to contribute more money and less time or in some cases both more money and more time, there's various other ways, so the projects that we that we do this often have the sustainability, financial sustainability built in, so they can they can finance themselves, so for example if we do t-shirts or if we try to do hydroponic, open-source hydroponic systems like Paralelni Garden tries to be all self sustainable in a decentralized way. So what I like to look, I like to look at it as a small virtual companies within the nonprofit, that have their costs and they try to generate some profit. But it's very wild, because we only use cryptocurrencies, that means that also it is much harder to do actual economic calculations, because you're accounting in something that is very volatile, and we have found ways on how to do that and how to not go totally bust, at least for now, tomorrow might be a different day, but yeah… Any more questions or next speaker? Yeah.

_Diego:_ Thank you so much! Pretty interesting, huh, pretty interesting. I went and visited them at their conference this past time, it's full of Bitcoin maximalist, but I forgive them for that. The really cool place, really cool place, yes. Monero! That's right! Monero is a way to beat…
