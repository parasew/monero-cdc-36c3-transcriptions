The Critical Decentralisation Cluster on the [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) (36C3) is an area and grouping of similar minded projects, which are offering workshops and host a space to critically discuss the future of decentralisation.

The cluster on [36C3](https://36c3.info/) is organised by [RIAT](https://riat.at/) and the [Monero Community](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/parasew-36c3/wiki/home). We also host [other assemblies](https://decentral.community/assemblies) in the categories Privacy & Anonymity, Coded Cultures and Open Hardware.

The cluster consists of a recording stage as well as workshop areas for the assemblies and similar minded groups and projects. Part of the cluster is a coffee area from Paralelni Polis, as well as lots of space to hack, work, and learn.

The [Chaos Computer Club](https://www.ccc.de/en/club) (CCC) is the largest (and oldest) hacker association in Europe and was [founded in 1981](https://berlin.ccc.de/~tim/tmp/tuwat-protokoll.pdf). The annual Chaos Communication Congress takes place end of the year, [since 1984](https://events.ccc.de/congress/). It is considered one of the largest (over 15,000 attendees) events of this kind, alongside the [DEF CON](https://defcon.org/) in Las Vegas.
